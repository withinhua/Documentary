# Phase 2 Acceptance — Native Export Parity (Task 2.11)

Native desktop export must beat the browser/wasm path on the two things that path
could not do: real ProRes (it silently downgraded ProRes → H.264) and encodes above
1080p (it clamped resolution for memory). This document splits the proof into what is
**automatically verified** in CI and what still requires **human on-screen verification**.

## Automatically proven (`apps/desktop/test/export-integration.test.ts`)

Run with: `pnpm --filter @openreel/desktop test:run export-integration`

All cases drive the **real bundled ffmpeg** (`resources/bin/<platform>-<arch>/ffmpeg`)
via the real `ExportJob` / direct spawn, streaming RGBA frames over stdin with
backpressure handling (no in-RAM video buffering — frames go straight to ffmpeg's
stdin and ffmpeg writes the file to disk).

1. **Native H.264, frames + audio → mp4** — hardware-selected encoder
   (`h264_videotoolbox` on macOS via `selectEncoder`). Probe asserts a Video stream,
   an Audio stream, and the requested 320x240 dimensions; output is non-zero.

2. **Native ProRes → `.mov` (Case A)** — encoder `prores_videotoolbox`
   (falls back to software `prores_ks` if the hardware encoder fails at runtime;
   either way the codec is genuine ProRes). RGBA frames + `pcm_s16le` audio in a MOV
   container. Probe asserts the Video stream codec is **prores** and an audio stream
   is present. This is the headline win: the wasm/WebCodecs path could only emit
   H.264, so ProRes requests were silently downgraded.

3. **Higher-than-1080p encode (Case B)** — `h264_videotoolbox` at **2560x1440**, a
   resolution the wasm path would have clamped to 1080p. Reuses `buildFfmpegArgs` +
   `ExportJob` (mp4/h264). Probe asserts the Video stream is present at the requested
   2560x1440. Proves caps are lifted in desktop mode.

4. **Streamed-to-disk via stdin** — every case writes frames through
   `ExportJob.writeFrame` (or a direct stdin write for ProRes) honoring `drain`
   backpressure; ffmpeg muxes directly to the output path. No full-video Blob is held
   in renderer memory.

## Requires human on-screen verification (Task 2.11 interactive)

These cover the GUI / end-to-end experience that headless tests cannot exercise:

1. **Real high-end project export.** In the desktop app, build/open a real project
   that is **4K (3840x2160), longer than 2 minutes, ProRes** (or H.265 10-bit), then
   Export. Confirm the export completes without error.

2. **Native save dialog + direct-to-disk write.** Confirm the native OS save dialog
   appears, and the chosen file is written **directly to the selected path** — not
   assembled as an in-RAM blob and then downloaded.

3. **No 1080p/30 clamp in desktop mode.** Confirm the exported file's resolution and
   frame rate match the project settings (e.g. 3840x2160 @ 60fps) and are **not**
   clamped to 1080p/30 the way the browser/WebCodecs path is.

4. **Progress + playback parity.** Confirm the export progress bar advances during the
   render, and the resulting file opens in a standard player (QuickTime / VLC) and
   matches the editor preview frame-for-frame in content and timing.

5. **Visual equivalence web vs desktop.** Export the same short project on **web
   (WebCodecs)** and on **desktop (native ffmpeg)**, then compare a decoded frame for
   visual equivalence, e.g.:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i out.mp4 -vf "select=eq(n\,30)" -vframes 1 frame.png
   ```

   The same frame index from each output should look equivalent (allowing for codec
   quantization differences).

## Known v1 limitation

For a **no-audio project**, any visual tail that extends beyond `timeline.duration`
may be truncated by `-shortest` (ffmpeg ends muxing at the shortest input stream).
Tracked as a v1 limitation — see spec §13.

# Desktop Native Pro Redesign — pending human checks (Phases 1–2)

Automated tests + builds are green; these need a real launch / packaged build to confirm:

- [ ] Frameless window renders with mac traffic lights aligned to the custom title bar (trafficLightPosition x:16 y:14) and `under-window` vibrancy is visible.
- [ ] Windows/Linux: custom min/max/close buttons work (minimize, toggle-maximize, close) and the title bar is draggable (no-drag on the controls + tab area).
- [ ] Native application menu shows File/Edit/View/Window/Help; native roles (undo/redo/cut/copy/paste/minimize/close/toggle-fullscreen/about/quit) function; accelerators (Cmd/Ctrl+N/O/E/Z) fire.
- [ ] The DaVinci-style charcoal/teal theme renders on the shell (title bar, workspace tabs, page bodies) — surfaces charcoal, accent teal, shadcn primitives (Select/DropdownMenu/focus rings) teal not emerald.
- [ ] Edit/Color/Deliver page tabs switch and persist across reload (ui-store desktopPage).
- [ ] Packaged build (`pnpm --filter @openreel/desktop run dist` with certs) — measure real installer size + cold-start per platform. Signed/notarized dist requires certs (mac hardened-runtime + notarize creds; Windows Authenticode) supplied via CI/env; per-platform native ffmpeg binaries must be present in resources/bin.
- [ ] Slimming confirmed in the packaged app: renderer ~5MB (ffmpeg.wasm stripped, fonts curated); native ffmpeg sidecar handles all decode/transcode/export.
- [ ] (Known v1 limitation) Non-curated picker fonts (Display/Serif/etc.) don't render on desktop until a lazy-font-load follow-up; curated/Popular families + Geist render correctly.

# Desktop polish pass — pending human checks (PP1–PP7)

Automated tests + builds are green; these need a real launch / packaged build to confirm:

- [ ] Rotating-logo loader appears on project open (PP2 loading screen renders and animates while the project hydrates).
- [ ] Editor layout (Media / Viewer / Inspector / Timeline) renders with resizable handles between panels and the Export button is present and functional.
- [ ] OpenReel app icon shows in the macOS dock (packaged build) and in the Windows taskbar / window chrome (`BrowserWindow.icon` on win/linux).
- [ ] SF-Symbols-style icons render correctly across the chrome (title bar, workspace tabs, toolbar, inspector) via the shared Icon system.
- [ ] Export produces a real file via the native FFmpeg sidecar (end-to-end from the Export button through the native export pipeline).
